## Requirements

- only linux compatability needed
- each benchmark run about 5min -> times 6 frequencies, times 2 governours = 60min
- benchmarks should not require GPU or heavy disk access
- benchmarks should not test (Linux) system specifics
- benchmarks should not require preinstalled software
- benchmarks should impact memory and/or most of the CPU cores

## Target workloads

- memory
- compression/decompression
